Bugs are generally introduced when you make changes. If you have working code and then suddenly you don't, odds are something you did caused the problem.

Check the diffs to see only what you changed; the problem is likely somewhere in there.

==================

How could having easy access to the history of a file...

You can code boldly...you don't have to be afraid of changing stuff because you know that you can always get back to what you had before.

==================

Pros / cons of manual vs automatic committing:

Pros: You get to choose when to commit.
Cons: You forget to commit until the end of the night.

==================

why does git allow multiple file saves?

Because Linus isn't an idiot and if you don't save the entire state of your project demons appear and eat your face.

==================

Git log / git diff?

Use git log to see how the repo has changed (there's a word for this but I can't bring it to mind.  Semantic changes?), use git diff to see the content of changes.

==================

As above, being able to go back in history makes you BOLD, and gives you REAL SOVIET CONFIDENCE

==================

"What do you want to use Git for?

Friggin everything.
